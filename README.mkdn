# NAME

MozRepl::RemoteObject - treat Javascript objects as Perl objects

# SYNOPSIS

    #!perl -w
    use strict;
    use MozRepl::RemoteObject;
    
    # use $ENV{MOZREPL} or localhost:4242
    my $repl = MozRepl::RemoteObject->install_bridge();
    
    # get our root object:
    my $tab = $repl->expr(<<JS);
        window.getBrowser().addTab()
    JS

    # Now use the object:
    my $body = $tab->{linkedBrowser}
                ->{contentWindow}
                ->{document}
                ->{body}
                ;
    $body->{innerHTML} = "<h1>Hello from MozRepl::RemoteObject</h1>";

    $body->{innerHTML} =~ '/Hello from/'
        and print "We stored the HTML";

    $tab->{linkedBrowser}->loadURI('http://corion.net/');

# BRIDGE SETUP

## `MozRepl::RemoteObject->install_bridge %options`

Installs the Javascript `<->` Perl bridge. If you pass in
an existing [MozRepl](https://metacpan.org/pod/MozRepl) instance, it must have [MozRepl::Plugin::JSON2](https://metacpan.org/pod/MozRepl::Plugin::JSON2)
loaded if you're running on a browser without native JSON support.

If `repl` is not passed in, `$ENV{MOZREPL}` will be used
to find the ip address and portnumber to connect to. If `$ENV{MOZREPL}`
is not set, the default of `localhost:4242` will be used.

If `repl` is not a reference, it will be used instead of `$ENV{MOZREPL}`.

To replace the default JSON parser, you can pass it in using the `json`
option.

- `repl` - a premade [MozRepl](https://metacpan.org/pod/MozRepl) instance to use, or alternatively a
connection string to use
- `use_queue` - whether to queue destructors until the next command. This
reduces the latency and amount of queries sent via [MozRepl](https://metacpan.org/pod/MozRepl) by half,
at the cost of a bit delayed release of objects on the remote side. The
release commands get queued until the next "real" command gets sent
through [MozRepl](https://metacpan.org/pod/MozRepl).
- `launch` - the command line to launch the program that runs `mozrepl`.

### Connect to a different machine

If you want to connect to a Firefox instance on a different machine,
call `->install_bridge` as follows:

    MozRepl::RemoteObject->install_bridge(
        repl => "$remote_machine:4242"
    );

### Using an existing MozRepl

If you want to pass in a preconfigured [MozRepl](https://metacpan.org/pod/MozRepl) object,
call `->install_bridge` as follows:

    my $repl = MozRepl->new;
    $repl->setup({
        log => [qw/ error info /],
        plugins => { plugins => [qw[ JSON2 ]] },
    });
    my $bridge = MozRepl::RemoteObject->install_bridge(repl => $repl);

### Launch a mozrepl program if it's not found running

If you want to launch Firefox if it's not already running,
call `->install_bridge` as follows:

    MozRepl::RemoteObject->install_bridge(
        launch => 'iceweasel' # that program must be in the path
    );

### Using a custom command line

By default the launched program will be launched with the `-repl`
command line switch to start up `mozrepl`. If you need to provide
the full command line, pass an array reference to the
`launch` option:

    MozRepl::RemoteObject->install_bridge(
        launch => ['iceweasel','-repl','666']
    );

### Using a custom Mozrepl class

By default, any class named in `$ENV{MOZREPL}` will get loaded and used
as the MozRepl backend. That value will get untainted!
If you want to prevent `$ENV{MOZREPL}`
from getting used, pass an explicit class name using the `repl_class`
option.

    MozRepl::RemoteObject->install_bridge(
        repl_class => 'MozRepl::AnyEvent',
    );

### Preventing/forcing native JSON

The Javascript part of MozRepl::RemoteObject will try to detect whether
to use the native Mozilla `JSON` object or whether to supply its own
JSON encoder from [MozRepl::Plugin::JSON2](https://metacpan.org/pod/MozRepl::Plugin::JSON2). To prevent the autodetection,
pass the `js_JSON` option:

    js_JSON => 'native', # force to use the native JSON object

    js_JSON => '', # force the json2.js encoder

The autodetection detects whether the connection has a native JSON
encoder and whether it properly transports UTF-8.

## `$bridge->expr( $js, $context )`

Runs the Javascript passed in through ` $js ` and links
the returned result to a Perl object or a plain
value, depending on the type of the Javascript result.

This is how you get at the initial Javascript object
in the object forest.

    my $window = $bridge->expr('window');
    print $window->{title};
    

You can also create Javascript functions and use them from Perl:

    my $add = $bridge->expr(<<JS);
        function (a,b) { return a+b }
    JS
    print $add->(2,3);
    # prints 5

The `context` parameter allows you to specify that you
expect a Javascript array and want it to be returned
as list. To do that, specify `'list'` as the `$context` parameter:

    for ($bridge->expr(<<JS,'list')) { print $_ };
        [1,2,3,4]
    JS

This is slightly more efficient than passing back an array reference
and then fetching all elements.

## `as_list( $array )`

    for $_ in (as_list $array) {
        print $_->{innerHTML},"\n";
    };

Efficiently fetches all elements from ` @$array `. This is
functionally equivalent to writing

    @$array

except that it involves much less roundtrips between Javascript
and Perl. If you find yourself using this, consider
declaring a Javascript function with `list` context
by using `->declare` instead.

## `$bridge->declare( $js, $context )`

Shortcut to declare anonymous JS functions
that will be cached in the bridge. This
allows you to use anonymous functions
in an efficient manner from your modules
while keeping the serialization features
of MozRepl::RemoteObject:

    my $js = <<'JS';
      function(a,b) {
          return a+b
      }
    JS
    my $fn = $self->bridge->declare($js);
    $fn->($a,$b);

The function `$fn` will remain declared
on the Javascript side
until the bridge is torn down.

If you expect an array to be returned and want the array
to be fetched as list, pass `'list'` as the `$context`.
This is slightly more efficient than passing an array reference
to Perl and fetching the single elements from Perl.

## `$bridge->constant( $NAME )`

    my $i = $bridge->constant( 'Components.interfaces.nsIWebProgressListener.STATE_STOP' );

Fetches and caches a Javascript constant. If you use this to fetch
and cache Javascript objects, this will create memory leaks, as these objects
will not get released.

## `$bridge->appinfo()`

Returns the `nsIXULAppInfo` object
so you can inspect what application
the bridge is connected to:

    my $info = $bridge->appinfo();
    print $info->{name}, "\n";
    print $info->{version}, "\n";
    print $info->{ID}, "\n";

## `$bridge->js_call_to_perl_struct( $js, $context )`

Takes a scalar with JS code, executes it, and returns
the result as a Perl structure.

This will not (yet?) cope with objects on the remote side, so you
will need to make sure to call `$rn.link()` on all objects
that are to persist across the bridge.

This is a very low level method. You are better advised to use
`$bridge->expr()` as that will know
to properly wrap objects but leave other values alone.

`$context` is passed through and tells the Javascript side
whether to return arrays as objects or as lists. Pass
`list` if you want a list of results instead of a reference
to a Javascript `array` object.

## `$bridge->remove_callback( $callback )`

    my $onload = sub {
        ...
    };
    $js_object->{ onload } = $onload;
    $bridge->remove_callback( $onload )

If you want to remove a callback that you instated,
this is the way.

This will release the resources associated with the callback
on both sides of the bridge.

## `$bridge->poll`

A crude no-op that can be used to just look if new events have arrived.

# HASH access

All MozRepl::RemoteObject objects implement
transparent hash access through overloading, which means
that accessing `$document->{body}` will return
the wrapped `document.body` object.

This is usually what you want when working with Javascript
objects from Perl.

Setting hash keys will try to set the respective property
in the Javascript object, but always as a string value,
numerical values are not supported.

# ARRAY access

Accessing an object as an array will mainly work. For
determining the `length`, it is assumed that the
object has a `.length` method. If the method has
a different name, you will have to access the object
as a hash with the index as the key.

Note that `push` expects the underlying object
to have a `.push()` Javascript method, and `pop`
gets mapped to the `.pop()` Javascript method.

# OBJECT IDENTITY

Object identity is currently implemented by
overloading the `==` operator.
Two objects are considered identical
if the javascript `===` operator
returns true.

    my $obj_a = MozRepl::RemoteObject->expr('window.document');
    print $obj_a->__id(),"\n"; # 42
    my $obj_b = MozRepl::RemoteObject->expr('window.document');
    print $obj_b->__id(), "\n"; #43
    print $obj_a == $obj_b; # true

# CALLING METHODS

Calling methods on a Javascript object is supported.

All arguments will be autoquoted if they contain anything
other than ASCII digits (`[0-9]`). There currently
is no way to specify that you want an all-digit parameter
to be put in between double quotes.

Passing MozRepl::RemoteObject objects as parameters in Perl
passes the proxied Javascript object as parameter to the Javascript method.

As in Javascript, functions are first class objects, the following
two methods of calling a function are equivalent:

    $window->loadURI('http://search.cpan.org/');
    
    $window->{loadURI}->('http://search.cpan.org/');

# EVENTS / CALLBACKS

This module also implements a rudimentary asynchronous
event dispatch mechanism. Basically, it allows you
to write code like this and it will work:

    $window->addEventListener('load', sub { 
         my ($event) = @_; 
         print "I got a " . $event->{type} . " event\n";
         print "on " . $event->{originalTarget};
    });
    # do other things...

Note that you cannot block the execution of Javascript that way.
The Javascript code has long continued running when you receive
the event.

Currently, only busy-waiting is implemented and there is no
way yet for Javascript to tell Perl it has something to say.
So in absence of a real mainloop, you have to call

    $repl->poll;

from time to time to look for new events. Note that _any_
call to Javascript will carry all events back to Perl and trigger
the handlers there, so you only need to use poll if no other
activity happens.

In the long run,
a move to [AnyEvent](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent) would make more sense, but currently,
MozRepl::RemoteObject is still under heavy development on
many fronts so that has been postponed.

# OBJECT METHODS

These methods are considered to be internal. You usually
do not want to call them from your code. They are
documented here for the rare case you might need to use them directly
instead of treating the objects as Perl structures. The
official way to access these functions is by using
[MozRepl::RemoteObject::Methods](https://metacpan.org/pod/MozRepl::RemoteObject::Methods) instead.

## `$obj->__invoke(METHOD, ARGS)`

The `->__invoke()` object method is an alternate way to
invoke Javascript methods. It is normally equivalent to 
`$obj->$method(@ARGS)`. This function must be used if the
METHOD name contains characters not valid in a Perl variable name 
(like foreign language characters).
To invoke a Javascript objects native `__invoke` method (if such a
thing exists), please use:

    $object->MozRepl::RemoteObject::Methods::invoke::invoke('__invoke', @args);

The same method can be used to call the Javascript functions with the
same name as other convenience methods implemented
by this package:

    __attr
    __setAttr
    __xpath
    __click
    ...

## `$obj->__transform_arguments(@args)`

This method transforms the passed in arguments to their JSON string
representations.

Things that match ` /^(?:[1-9][0-9]*|0+)$/ ` get passed through.

MozRepl::RemoteObject::Instance instances
are transformed into strings that resolve to their
Javascript global variables. Use the `->expr` method
to get an object representing these.

It's also impossible to pass a negative or fractional number
as a number through to Javascript, or to pass digits as a Javascript string.

## `$obj->__id`

Readonly accessor for the internal object id
that connects the Javascript object to the
Perl object.

## `$obj->__on_destroy`

Accessor for the callback
that gets invoked from `DESTROY`.

## `$obj->bridge`

Readonly accessor for the bridge
that connects the Javascript object to the
Perl object.

## `$obj->__release_action`

Accessor for Javascript code that gets executed
when the Perl object gets released.

## `$obj->__attr( $attribute )`

Read-only accessor to read the property
of a Javascript object.

    $obj->__attr('foo')
    

is identical to

    $obj->{foo}

## `$obj->__setAttr( $attribute, $value )`

Write accessor to set a property of a Javascript
object.

    $obj->__setAttr('foo', 'bar')
    

is identical to

    $obj->{foo} = 'bar'

## `$obj->__dive( @PATH )`

**DEPRECATED** - this method will vanish somewhere after 0.23.
Use [MozRepl::RemoteObject::Methods::dive](https://metacpan.org/pod/MozRepl::RemoteObject::Methods::dive) instead.

Convenience method to quickly dive down a property chain.

If any element on the path is missing, the method dies
with the error message which element was not found.

This method is faster than descending through the object
forest with Perl, but otherwise identical.

    my $obj = $tab->{linkedBrowser}
                  ->{contentWindow}
                  ->{document}
                  ->{body}

    my $obj = $tab->__dive(qw(linkedBrowser contentWindow document body));

## `$obj->__keys()`

Please use instead:

    keys %$obj

The function returns the names of all properties
of the javascript object as a list, just like the `keys`
Perl function.

    $obj->__keys()

is identical to

    keys %$obj

## `$obj->__values()`

Please use instead:

    values %$obj

Returns the values of all properties
as a list.

    $obj->values()
    

is identical to

    values %$obj

## `$obj->__xpath( $query [, $ref ] )`

**DEPRECATED** - this method will vanish somewhere after 0.23.
Use [MozRepl::RemoteObject::Methods::xpath](https://metacpan.org/pod/MozRepl::RemoteObject::Methods::xpath) instead:

    $obj->MozRepl::RemoteObject::Methods::xpath( $query )

Executes an XPath query and returns the node
snapshot result as a list.

This is a convenience method that should only be called
on HTMLdocument nodes.

The optional `$ref` parameter can be a DOM node relative to which a
relative XPath expression will be evaluated. It defaults to `undef`.

The optional `$cont` parameter can be a Javascript function that
will get applied to every result. This can be used to directly map
each DOM node in the XPath result to an attribute. For example
for efficiently fetching the text value of an XPath query resulting in
textnodes, the two snippets are equivalent, but the latter executes
less roundtrips between Perl and Javascript:

    my @text = map { $_->{nodeValue} }
        $obj->MozRepl::RemoteObject::Methods::xpath( '//p/text()' )


    my $fetch_nodeValue = $bridge->declare(<<JS);
        function (e){ return e.nodeValue }
    JS
    my @text = map { $_->{nodeValue} }
        $obj->MozRepl::RemoteObject::Methods::xpath( '//p/text()', undef, $fetch_nodeValue )

## `$obj->__click`

Sends a Javascript `click` event to the object.

This is a convenience method that should only be called
on HTMLdocument nodes or their children.

## `$obj->__change`

Sends a Javascript `change` event to the object.

This is a convenience method that should only be called
on HTMLdocument nodes or their children.

## `$obj->__event TYPE`

Sends a Javascript event of type `TYPE` to the object.

This is a convenience method that should only be called
on HTMLdocument nodes or their children.

### Send a `focus`, `change` and `blur` event to an element

The following code simulates the events sent by the
user entering a value into a field:

    $elt->__event('focus');
    $elt->{value} = 'Hello';
    $elt->__event('change');
    $elt->__event('blur');
    

## `MozRepl::RemoteObject::Instance->new( $bridge, $ID, $onDestroy )`

This creates a new Perl object that's linked to the
Javascript object `ID`. You usually do not call this
directly but use `$bridge->link_ids @IDs`
to wrap a list of Javascript ids with Perl objects.

The `$onDestroy` parameter should contain a Javascript
string that will be executed when the Perl object is
released.
The Javascript string is executed in its own scope
container with the following variables defined:

- `self` - the linked object
- `id` - the numerical Javascript object id of this object
- `repl` - the [MozRepl](https://metacpan.org/pod/MozRepl) Javascript `repl` object

This method is useful if you want to automatically
close tabs or release other resources
when your Perl program exits.

# ENCODING

The communication with the MozRepl plugin is done
through 7bit safe ASCII. The received bytes are supposed
to be UTF-8, but this seems not always to be the case,
so the JSON encoder on the Javascript side also
uses a 7bit safe encoding.

Currently there is no way to specify a different encoding
on the fly. You have to replace or reconfigure
the JSON object in the constructor.

# TODO

- For tests that connect to the outside world,
check/ask whether we're allowed to. If running
automated, skip.
- Think more about how to handle object identity.
Should `Scalar::Util::refaddr` return true whenever
the Javascript `===` operator returns true?

    Also see [http://perlmonks.org/?node\_id=802912](http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=802912)

- Consider whether MozRepl actually always delivers
UTF-8 as output.
- Properly encode all output that gets send towards
[MozRepl](https://metacpan.org/pod/MozRepl) into the proper encoding.
- Can we find a sensible implementation of string
overloading for JS objects? Should it be the
respective JS object type?
- Add truely lazy objects that don't allocate their JS counterparts
until an `__attr()` is requested or a method call is made.

    This is an optimization and hence gets postponed.

- Potentially do away with attaching to the repl object and keep
all elements as anonymous functions referenced only by Perl variables.

    This would have the advantage of centralizing the value wrapping/unwrapping
    in one place, `__invoke`, and possibly also in `__as_code`. It would
    also keep the precompiled JS around instead of recompiling it on
    every access.

    `repl.wrapResults` would have to be handed around in an interesting
    manner then though.

- Add proper event wrappers and find a mechanism to send such events.

    Having `__click()` is less than desireable. Maybe blindly adding
    the `click()` method is preferrable.

- Implement fetching of more than one property at once through \_\_attr()
- Implement automatic reblessing of JS objects into Perl objects
based on a typemap instead of blessing everything into
MozRepl::RemoteObject::Instance.
- Find out how to make MozRepl actively send responses instead
of polling for changes.

    This would lead to implementing a full two-way message bus.

    `repl.print()` can create arbitrary output, but [Net::Telnet](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::Telnet)
    is not prepared to consume it.

    On the Javascript side, `yield` can be used to implement
    continuations in a way that could maybe allow us to "suspend" the currently
    executing Javascript callback to introduce synchronous callbacks from
    Javascript into Perl.

- Consider using/supporting [AnyEvent](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent) for better compatibility
with other mainloops.

    This would lead to implementing a full two-way message bus.

- Should I make room for promises as well?

        my ($foo,$bar);
        $bridge->transaction(sub {
            $foo = $obj->promise;
            $bar = $obj2->promise;
        });

    The JS could instantiate another level of proxy objects
    that would have to get filled by a batch of JS statements
    sent from Perl to fill in all those promises.

        $bridge->promise( 'window' )
        could return
        sub { $bridge->expr('window') }
        

    but that wouldn't allow for coalescing these promises into Javascript.

- Create synchronous Javascript callbacks by blocking
the current FireFox thread. This shouldn't block the
rest of FireFox:

          /**
           * Netscape compatible WaitForDelay function.
           * You can use it as an alternative to Thread.Sleep() in any major programming language
           * that support it while JavaScript it self doesn't have any built-in function to do such a thing.
           * parameters:
           * (Number) delay in millisecond
          */
          function nsWaitForDelay(delay) {
              /**
                * Just uncomment this code if you're building an extention for Firefox.
                * Since FF3, we'll have to ask for user permission to execute XPCOM objects.
                */
              // netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalXPConnect");
               
              // Get the current thread.
              var thread = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/thread-manager;1"].getService(Components.interfaces.nsIThreadManager).currentThread;
               
              // Create an inner property to be used later as a notifier.
              this.delayed = true;
               
              /* Call JavaScript setTimeout function
                * to execute this.delayed = false
                * after it finish.
                */
              setTimeout("this.delayed = false;", delay);
               
              /**
                * Keep looping until this.delayed = false
                */
              while (this.delayed) {
              /**
                * This code will not freeze your browser as it's documented in here:
                * https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Code_snippets/Threads#Waiting_for_a_background_task_to_complete
                */
              thread.processNextEvent(true);
              }
          }
